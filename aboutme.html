<p>Fun Fact: Im the youngest of 5 kids.</p>  
<p>About Me: I live in Arizona which is where part of the senorian desert is located so its hot almost year round. Im going to be 17 years old in a couple days. Im currently in the summer going into my senior year. This summer Im in a program called girls who code where we are learning different codeing languages in the begining we started off creating group projects using somthing called scratch. below shows pictures of a game we made.</p>

<p>Projects:<p>  
  
<div style="float:left; width:50%"><img src="Screen Shot 2017-06-26 at 1.44.49 PM.png" width=100%></div>
<div style="float:right; width:50%"><p>Discription: In this game we created multiple bars that fell at random at a certain distance from eachother, the point of the game was to keep an orb from touching the bottom of the screen so the player has to keep the orb bouncing from bar to bar using the space and arrow keys.</p></div>

 <p>Discription: In this next project with a partner using python we created code that would import an image that we chose and would recolor it by taking the sum of the tupples in each pixel then determining the color of the pixel as the information runs through the conditionals. Resulting in something like the image shown to the right.
